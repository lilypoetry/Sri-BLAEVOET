        <title>Milky Way</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>Milky Way Galaxy, large spiral system consisting of several hundred billion stars, 
            one of which is the Sun. It takes its name from the Milky Way, the irregular 
            luminous band of stars and gas clouds that stretches across the sky as seen from 
            Earth. Although Earth lies well within the Milky Way Galaxy (sometimes simply 
            called the Galaxy), astronomers do not have as complete an understanding of 
            its nature as they do of some external star systems. A thick layer of interstellar 
            dust obscures much of the Galaxy from scrutiny by optical telescopes, and 
            astronomers can determine its large-scale structure only with the aid of radio 
            and infrared telescopes, which can detect the forms of radiation that penetrate 
            the obscuring matter.</p>
